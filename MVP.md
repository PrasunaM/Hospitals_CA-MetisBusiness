# Business Module: Medical centers in Calfornia

### Opportunity
California is the 3rd largest state in the United states with a population of around 39.37 million. Unfortunately, it only offers [1.9 beds per 1000 people](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/beds-by-ownership/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedDistributions=total&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Total%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) which is below the national average of 2.89 and 3rd lowest in the country. With Coronavirus on an unexpected surge last year this capacity was tested to its limits. 
Moreover, state initiated health plans such as covered california have resulted in a significant decrease in the [uninsured](https://www.chcf.org/publication/how-many-your-area-are-covered-affordable-care-act/#:~:text=California%27s%20uninsured%20rate%20has%20fallen,has%20dropped%20by%203.7%20million) which means higher reimbursement for the medical providers. 

Given these circumstances, ABC medical center which operates primarily in Texas would like to expand into California. The goal of this project is to create a proposal with insights about the healthcare landscape in California. 

### Impact

ABC medical center is able to establish 2 medical centers over a period of 3 years in the most profitable counties within a budget of 4 billion dollars.
