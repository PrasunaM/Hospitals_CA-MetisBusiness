# Business Module: Medical centers in Calfornia

### Opportunity
California is the 3rd largest state in the United states with a population of around 39.37 million. Unfortunately, it only offers [1.9 beds per 1000 people](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/beds-by-ownership/?currentTimeframe=0&selectedDistributions=total&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Total%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) which is below the national average of 2.89 and 3rd lowest in the country. With Coronavirus on an unexpected surge last year this capacity was tested to its limits. 
Moreover, state initiated health plans such as covered california have resulted in a significant decrease in the [uninsured](https://www.chcf.org/publication/how-many-your-area-are-covered-affordable-care-act/#:~:text=California%27s%20uninsured%20rate%20has%20fallen,has%20dropped%20by%203.7%20million) which means higher reimbursement for the medical providers. 

Given these circumstances, ABC medical center which operates primarily in the east coast would like to expand into California. The goal of this project is to identify ideal locations, sizes and types of insurance contracts that can be most profitable by analyzing past data.

### Data Science Solution Paths

A regression Model which can predict profits given a combination of location, size, insurance contracts and expenses.

### Preliminary impact hypothesis

Considering the recommendations given by the built model, ABC medical center is able to establish 2 profitable medical centers over a period of 3 years.

### Preliminary Visualizations

In order to identify the most and least profitable counties over the years, I created a pivot table and grouped net patient revenue by county and year. Please review below visualization from Excel
