# Hospitals in California 

California is the most populated state in the U.S but unfortunately has a capacity of only 1.9 beds per 1000 which is much lower compared to other states. The aim of this project is look into the hospital data and understand the distribution of hospitals, insurance contracts and beds for every county. 

This research was performed as part of a feasibility analysis for expansion project of ABC Medical Center. Data was obtained from [CHHS Open Data](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/fourth-quarter-summary-hospital-utilization-net-patient-revenue-by-payer-source)
